Attendance made easy

To download the file:
  1. Click on CSV-Attendance.exe
  2. Click on download
  3. Google will prompt you to discard the file, however to keep the file you must use the arrow beside it to open up a tab where you will see the option to keep the file.
  4. Click on keep
  5. Now run the file
  6. (For windows users) You will find that windows does not recognise this file. This is fine. Click on "More info", followed by "Run anyway"

Ensure the directory that the executable is stored in has the following files in it too:
  - A file called "Session{}" with the session number replacing the braces
  - A file called "RollCall" saved in the CSV UTF-8 (Comma delimited) format

If these files are not in the directory, the program will not work.

This will create a new CSV file named "RollChecked {}" with the session number replacing the braces.

If the program fails to run, it will shut down immediately. Ensure the necessary files are present and run the program again.
